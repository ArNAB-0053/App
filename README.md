# Welcome to the !

This repository includes the project of a leaf disease detection system named **"Groot"**

## Introduction-

If you just focus on the needs of human survival, there are basically four main things-
* Food
* shelter
* air 
* water

Today we are going to solve a silly problem yet a big solution. Its the most underrated thing that we humans just ignore. We just ignore the fact of its existence and a huge impact is faced by us every year. Yet this problem has been under existence before every sapiens or homo sapiens existence!!

If you can't guess it by now, then let me take you to the journey of the most silly problem with a "Groot" Solution!!!


## **Problem Statement-**

The main problem that we have given hints above is basically the diseases that occur in the plant and visible through our eyes on the leaf.
